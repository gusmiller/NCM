New Connections Ministries

In 1998 <b>New Connections Ministries (NCM)</b> was established as an outreach to men in prisons across Eastern Ontario. These initial contacts soon led to providing follow-up, upon their release into the community, and to ministering to the families of these men. It became clear that many of the men to whom we were ministering, were struggling with addictions to alcohol, drugs and sexual immorality. These addictions were the main reason for re-offences, re-incarceration, and further anguish for our clients, and their families. Even after coming to faith in the Lord Jesus Christ, the men remained in bondage to their addictions. In an effort to meet some of these needs, the ministry has expanded over the past few years and now includes a community-based support home.
In an effort to meet ongoing needs, a 5-bed support home was established in Ottawa in 2005 to provide safe living arrangements and support men recently released from prison or men who have completed an addiction treatment program.
